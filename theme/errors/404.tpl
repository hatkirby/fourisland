	<h2>Hello, my name is Waddle Dee</h2>

	<p>
		Aaaa.... well... I'm really sorry, but I can't find the page you're looking for. Really, I'm so sorry! Please don't tell Hat Kirby! This is 
		the 17'th page I lost this week!
	</p>

	<p>
		Oh wait. Here we go. We can't find your page because... hmmm... oh not again... It seems Kirby ate the page you are looking for.
		Yes, I'm really sorry! He gets really hungry sometimes (all of the time) but we try to keep him fed.

			Anyway, instead of talking to me, you can:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Swim over to <a href="http://fourisland.com/">Fourever Island</a></li>
			<li>Try <a href="http://fourisland.com/fourm/">The Fourm</a>!</li>
			<li>Or maybe you could go to the <a href="http://code.fourisland.com">Mercurial Respository</a>!</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			I'm sure you'll have fun.
		</p>

			<strong>Oh, oh! More info has come in! You may not be able to find the page because of:</strong>
		</p>

		<ol type="A">
			<li>An <strong>out-of-date bookmark/favourite</strong></li>
			<li>A search engine that has an <strong>out-of-date listing for us</strong></li>
			<li>A <strong>mis-typed address</strong></li>
		</ol>
	<!--END NOREFERER-->

	<!--BEGIN SEARCHREF-->
		<p>
			<strong>Oh, oh! More info has come in!</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			You did a search on <strong><a href="<!--SEARCHREF.REF-->" target="_blank"><!--SEARCHREF.SITE--></a></strong>
			for "<strong><!--SEARCHREF.TERMS--></strong>". However, their index appears to be out of date. Because Kirby ate the page, no doubt.
		</p>

		<p>
			All is not lost! Why not try one of these links?
		</p>

		<ul>

			<strong>Oh, oh! More info has come in!</strong>

		<p>
			You were referred to this page by:
			<strong><a href="<!--NORMALREF.REF-->" target="_blank"><!--NORMALREF.SITE--></a></strong><br />
			I guess they didn't know that Kirby ate the page.

				Wait a minute! That's us! Uh oh! It looks like one of our own links is broken!
				I'm really sorry about this, and I'll try to fix it before Hatkirby notices.
				Please PM "hatkirby" on The Fourm, or post a topic about it in "Fourscore Improvements". Thanks!
