<H2>Hello, my name is Waddle Dee</H2>

<P>
	Aaaa.... well... I'm really sorry, but I can't find the page you're looking for. Really, I'm so sorry! Please don't tell Hat Kirby! This is 
	the 17'th page I lost this week!
</P>

<P>
	Oh wait. Here we go. We can't find your page because... hmmm... oh not again... It seems Kirby ate the page you are looking for.
	Yes, I'm really sorry! He gets really hungry sometimes (all of the time) but we try to keep him fed.
</P>

			Wait a minute! That's us! Uh oh! It looks like one of our own links is broken!
			I'm really sorry about this, and I'll try to fix it before Hatkirby notices.
			Please PM "hatkirby" on The Fourm, or post a topic about it in "Fourscore Improvements". Thanks!
